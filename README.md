# itracing2
itracing2 is a free and open source application that allow to (really?) use iTag devices.

It can run in background, so you are not mandatory to launch itracing2 after booting your phone.
By checking "background link", you could use the button on front of your itag.

several actions are available:

* capture your current position
* ringing your phone
* vibrate your phone

launch the camera is not allowed unless re-write a camera app inside itracing2 (so, this is not my priority)

several users tell me to add multi-devices support. I bought an another chinese iTag, and
i hope to write this feature soon.

*don't remember that is a personal project and feel free to participate :)*
